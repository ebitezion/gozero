Q12. (1) Map function A map()-function is a function that takes a function and a
list. The function is applied to each member in the list and a new list containing these
calculated values is returned. Thus:
map(f(),(a1, a2, . . . , an−1, an)) = (f(a1), f(a2), . . . , f(an−1), f(an))
1. Write a simple map()-function in Go. It is sufficient for this function only to work
for ints.
2. Expand your code to also work on a list of strings.
